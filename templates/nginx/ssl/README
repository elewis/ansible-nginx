DO NOT USE FOR REAL CERTIFICATES

These are included only for the default-deny site, which requires a cert to be available for the
initial connection before immediately dropping it when the request does not match enabled sites.

Generated using the command below:

	openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout nginx-self.key -out nginx-self.pem -days 365 -nodes
